LimitlessPiano - Empowerment.  Portability, visualization, motion interaction, and an 88-key piano in an interactive environment.  Combine all these things and you have LimitlessPiano.  Pianos are hard to move, whether that be keyboards or upright pianos.  We will empower through portability.  Also, for people with hearing disabilities, physical pianos don't provide much feedback.  For someone that is deaf, touching a key does not provide any visible/fulfilling output. Through touch and music visualizations, people with hearing disabilities can have a more fulfilling piano playing experience through Limitless Piano.  Limitless Piano empowers the player, and provides a satisfying piano playing experience for everyone.
